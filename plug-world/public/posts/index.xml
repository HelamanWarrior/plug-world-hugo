      <description>Crazy right!?
Why do this? Here&amp;rsquo;s why&amp;hellip; Addiction Social media is naturally made to be addictive. Over the past 10 years, social media has been finetuned to work against you and to push for your attention. Social Media Impacts the Whole World Maybe a sound like a conspiracy theorist when I say this, but unlike them there&amp;rsquo;s actually evidence. Most people use social media, it impacts a very large aspect of the world.</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Crazy right!?</p>
<h2 id="why-do-this-heres-why">Why do this? Here&rsquo;s why&hellip;</h2>
<ol>
<li>Addiction
<ul>
<li>Social media is naturally made to be addictive.</li>
<li>Over the past 10 years, social media has been finetuned to work against you and to push for your attention.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Social Media Impacts the Whole World
<ul>
<li>Maybe a sound like a conspiracy theorist when I say this, but unlike them there&rsquo;s actually evidence.</li>
<li>Most people use social media, it impacts a very large aspect of the world.</li>
<li>Most social media generally has an &ldquo;algorithm&rdquo; to promote content. This algorithm is always being balanced and modified ever so slightly.
<ul>
<li>They modify it to make people think certain ways, or to promote certain types of content over others. Effectively giving them the ability to brainwash the world.</li>
<li>Don&rsquo;t believe me? Look at those Tiktok challenges. No other platform promoted these challenges as much as Tiktok. It convinced people to do stupid things that they wouldn&rsquo;t have done otherwise.
<ul>
<li>It even got to the point that schools had to shutdown.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>So believe what you want, but you can&rsquo;t deny social media has the biggest impact, bigger than the greatest kings and queens of the world.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Not Being in Control Over Content
<ul>
<li>How are you not in control? You get to choose who you follow. Yep you do, but I constantly get crap in my feed that I don&rsquo;t want to see.</li>
<li>Things that I don&rsquo;t follow get forced in my face no matter what.</li>
<li>I want to be in control of the things that I get to see on social media.</li>
<li>In my opinion it would be best just to be connected with your friends and family. I don&rsquo;t care about the celebrities and all the other junk that gets thrown in my face.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Being a Hypocrite
<ul>
<li>I don&rsquo;t support where social media is headed, and how manipulative it&rsquo;s getting.</li>
<li>Therefore, I will not use it. <em>Under normal circumstances</em></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="why-i-kinda-use-social-media">Why I Kinda Use Social Media</h2>
<p>A couple of months ago I deleted my Instagram account.
I used it primary with connecting with friends.
And since then I have started to regret it.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s my philosophy that led to me deleting it.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>If you don&rsquo;t support it, don&rsquo;t use it.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>You know, basically don&rsquo;t be a hypocrite.</p>
<p>Since then, I missed seeing what my friends are up to and connecting to them through that.
So it&rsquo;s hard to support both, you know?
I don&rsquo;t want to support Facebook by using Instagram, but I want to support my friends by seeing and messaging with them on the platform.</p>
<p>So I decided to get back on the platform.
But I have a specific way of going about things that screws over Facebook and Instagram 😂</p>
<h2 id="the-solution">The Solution</h2>
<p>I won&rsquo;t post on Instagram.
I will instead be using my <a href="/microblog">microblog</a>.</p>
<ul>
<li>Posts on my microblog will be similar to how I would post on Instagram.</li>
<li>I will keep my <a href="/posts">blog</a> seperate, because my posts there will be more technical and informational.</li>
</ul>
<p>I use the regular Instagram web client.
I dabbled using <a href="https://instaloader.github.io/">Instaloader</a>.
Which is basically just a Instagram command line scraper, but it almost led to me getting banned.
So I guess I won&rsquo;t be going with that.</p>
<p>Advantages using Instagram web instead of the app&hellip;</p>
<ol>
<li>No ads and less tracking.
<ul>
<li>Using <a href="https://ublockorigin.com/">uBlockOrigin</a> addon to block them along with the <a href="https://f-droid.org/en/packages/us.spotco.fennec_dos/">Mull browser</a>.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>No promotion of accounts I don&rsquo;t follow.</li>
<li>Tiktok style stories aren&rsquo;t in the feed.</li>
</ol>
<p>Basically I only see the posts of people I follow.</p>
<p>Anyways, social media is messy and big tech is making it a terrible platform to be on.
Social media isn&rsquo;t all bad, it&rsquo;s definitely being used for good.
But the platforms are designed to work against you for your attention.
So it&rsquo;s best to have alternative ways of reaching others, not just through social media.</p>
<h2 id="get-a-website">Get a Website</h2>
<p>If you are reading this and you don&rsquo;t have a website, I encourage you <strong>get a website!</strong></p>
<p>Everyone uses the same 5 websites, it&rsquo;s important that you own your own land on the internet.
Most people can agree owning a house is much better than having to pay rent in an appartment.
<strong>Do this on the internet!</strong>
Post what you learn on your website, make posts that you would normally only do on Instagram, and put them on your website.</p>
<p>The information you learn is valuable, and your experiences and memories are unreplacable.
With a website you have the freedom to display your information however you want and the freedom to own it.</p>
<p>I have found that this has made me a better writer, and has helped keep my thoughts more clear and organized.
It may seem like a lot of work, but you can get a lot out of doing this.</p>
<p>You can use <a href="https://wordpress.org/">Wordpress</a> or <a href="https://blogger.com">Blogger</a>, just start using something.</p>
<p>I use <a href="https://gohugo.io/">Hugo</a> which is a bit more advanced for the average user, but still very simple once setup.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>Social media addiction is really harmful.
Please try to find what works best for you.
I find with this solution I have been able to improve myself, while also maintaining connection with my friends and family.
That&rsquo;s what matters most, do your best to be better, little by little everyday.
You will find that you can do amazing things.</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t start tomorrow, start today.
Thank you for taking the time to read to read this.
Please <a href="/contact">contact me</a> if you have any questions, or if you just want to talk.
Thanks! 😃</p>

      <description>This guide is tailored to people that are dualbooting Linux and Windows. The exact same steps can accomplish adding another Linux OS to the bootloader.
Prerequisites sudo pacman -S grub efibootmgr os-prober ntfs-3g Mounting Windows Drive sudo mount -t ntfs-3g /dev/sda2 /mnt Don&amp;rsquo;t just copy this command. Make sure you use the correct drive. You can find each drive by name when using lsblk. Usually you want to mount the smallest partition.</description>

      <guid>https://plug-world.com/posts/fixing-xbox-bluetooth-controllers-in-arch-linux/</guid>
      <description>Just like many others, I had issues with my Xbox One X/S controllers in Arch Linux. Here&amp;rsquo;s my quick guide to get everything working.
Setting up Bluetooth Since you are on Arch Linux there&amp;rsquo;s a good chance you may not have Bluetooth installed.
sudo pacman -S bluez bluez-utils Bluez provides the Bluetooth protocol stack. Bluz-utils provides a command line utility to connect bluetooth devices.
sudo systemctl enable bluetooth.service Automatically autostart bluetooth as a service when the system boots.</description>

</span></span></code></pre></div><p>Startup the bluetooth service.</p>
<h2 id="connecting-the-controller-via-bluetooth">Connecting the controller via Bluetooth</h2>
<p>Run <code>bluetoothctl</code> in the command line to startup the bluetooth utility.</p>
<p>Run <code>power on</code> to turn on the bluetooth controller.</p>
<p>Run <code>scan on</code> to get a list of each of the devices and their mac addresses.
Your Xbox controller should show up as &ldquo;Xbox Wireless Controller&rdquo; then copy the mac address.</p>
<p>Run <code>pair yourControllerMacAddress</code>, this will connect your Bluetooth controller.
If you run into pairing issues, proceed to the next section.</p>
<h2 id="controller-bluetooth-fix">Controller Bluetooth fix</h2>
<p>Is your controller having Bluetooth connection issues?
The solution is to update the firmware in the controller.</p>
<ol>
<li>Jump over to Windows, don&rsquo;t worry this is temporary (you can use a VM too).</li>
<li>Download the Xbox Accessories app from the Microsoft Store.</li>
<li>Plug in the controller to the pc.</li>
<li>Get them updates.</li>
</ol>
<p>Now that the controller is updated, you can switch back to your Arch Linux install.
You can see that the controller can connect over Bluetooth.</p>
<h2 id="fixing-controller-mappings">Fixing controller mappings</h2>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;"><code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash"><span style="display:flex;"><span>sudo pacman -S linux-headers

</span></span></code></pre></div><p>Make sure you have the <a href="https://www.tecmint.com/install-yay-aur-helper-in-arch-linux-and-manjaro/">yay aur helper</a> installed.
Then proceed to install xpadneo.
It contains the drivers for the Xbox One wireless controllers.
This fixes the strange behavior of the operating system misinterpreting some of the controls on the controller.
For example, my controller had issues with the right joystick and a few face buttons were mixed up.
After installing the drivers those issues were resolved.</p>

      <description>Original YouTube Link So if you didn&amp;rsquo;t know Brave, the company behind the Brave Browser, created a search engine not too long ago. Brave Search is actually a really interesting project. Brave advertises itself as a private search engine. Now I&amp;rsquo;m not here to talk about privacy. Just talking about the features of the project. But it&amp;rsquo;s up to you to trust them. Their source code is public, but their servers aren&amp;rsquo;t.</description>

<p>So if you didn&rsquo;t know Brave, the company behind the <a href="https://brave.com/">Brave Browser</a>, created a <a href="https://search.brave.com/">search engine</a> not too long ago.
Brave Search is actually a really interesting project.
Brave advertises itself as a private search engine.
Now I&rsquo;m not here to talk about privacy.
Just talking about the features of the project.
But it&rsquo;s up to you to trust them.
Their <a href="https://github.com/orgs/brave/repositories">source code</a> is public, but their servers aren&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>Brave created their own indexer for the results in Brave Search.
This is not the case with other search engines like <a href="https://duckduckgo.com/">DuckDuckGo</a> and <a href="https://www.qwant.com/">Qwant</a>.
Both of which use Bing results.
This alone ranks Brave Search above other search engines for me.
Just because it&rsquo;s actually different from the others.</p>
<p>So what are <a href="https://search.brave.com/help/goggles">Brave Goggles</a>?
They are essentially a way of filtering search results.
Or as Brave puts it, &ldquo;Goggles act as a custom re-ranking on top of the Brave search index.&rdquo;
The internet is full of garbage.
So many websites copying each other, all fighting to be at the top.
Gotta make that ad revenue.
But with this new tool allows you to sift through all the garbage on the internet with ease.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="/images/posts/brave-goggles-changes-how-i-search/following-goggles.webp" alt="Following Goggles"  />
</p>
<p>Now you have full control to manually rank your search results.
No more relying on an algorithm to do it for you.
Brave says it best, &ldquo;Goggles allows users to counter any intrinsic biases in the algorithm.&rdquo;
You can try out <a href="https://search.brave.com/goggles">Brave Goggles here</a>.
Take a look at the Brave Goggles <a href="https://github.com/brave/goggles-quickstart/">source code</a>.
If you look at <a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/brave/goggles-quickstart/main/goggles/tech_blogs.goggle">&ldquo;Tech Blogs&rdquo;</a> as an example, it shows every domain it is boosting and downranking.
Really simple and easy syntax.
All to make it easy for you to tailor your own results.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="/images/posts/brave-goggles-changes-how-i-search/goggles-syntax.webp" alt="Tech blogs Syntax"  />
</p>
<p>You can even find goggles that the community has made through the <a href="https://search.brave.com/goggles/discover">discovery page</a>.
Whenever you make your custom goggles you will have the choice to make it public.</p>
<p>I started following a few goggles.
They have proven to be very helpful when searching for specific results.
For example I would often look for programming solutions and have to filter with site:stackoverflow.com or site:github.com.
Not anymore.
Now I just use the <a href="https://search.brave.com/goggles/discover?goggles_id=https%3A%2F%2Fraw.githubusercontent.com%2FAdventistforever%2Fbrave-programming-goggle%2Fmain%2Fprogramming.goggle">&ldquo;Programming solutions&rdquo;</a> goggle and I get the results I need from Brave Search.</p>

      <description>Original YouTube Link Intro Arch is often not recommended to new Linux users. This is caused by the fact that you have to run a lot of commands to install and configure your system. The terminal is scary. The terminal is made for hackers. That pushes new users away from it.
Despite all of that, I would recommend Arch Linux to beginners.

I heard a lot of good things about it.
Packages are up to date and stable.
But it sucked.
The package manager was sooo slow.
Updates took forever.
I had constant issues with the wifi on my laptop.
It led to me manually having to request ip addresses from my router using <code>sudo dhclient -v</code>
One problem would lead to the next.
Constant issues and configuration.
Then I gave up.
I wasted a whole week.

Instead, I used <a href="https://alt.fedoraproject.org/en/">Fedora Everything</a>.</p>
<p>I tried the Fedora workstation install initially.
But I hated it.
I didn&rsquo;t like <a href="https://www.gnome.org/">Gnome</a>.
The system ran slow, and wasn&rsquo;t as snappy as I was hoping.
It had over 2000 packages installed by default.
In comparison my Arch install on my desktop has 1805 packages.
I have many packages I don&rsquo;t use, tons of apps installed, and steam games.
And yet it is less bloated than a vanilla Fedora install.</p>
<p>This led to me using Fedora Everything.
It&rsquo;s just the essentials.
It boots to the terminal just like Arch.
Nothing additional installed.
<a href="https://github.com/HelamanWarrior/Fedora-Installer">I created a script</a> to automatically install everything I needed.
It had my window manager (<a href="https://github.com/baskerville/bspwm">BSPWM</a>), terminal (<a href="https://st.suckless.org/">st</a>), <a href="https://polybar.github.io/">polybar</a>, <a href="https://github.com/HelamanWarrior/dotfiles">dot files</a> and all of that fun stuff.</p>
<p>According to my virtual machine the script worked great.
It should be great to install quickly on multiple machines.
Nope, it wasn&rsquo;t.
It sucked.
Constant issues with Fedora working with my laptop hardware.
It was an endless rabbithole of maintainance and fixing things.
I had an <a href="https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/NVIDIA_Optimus">Nvidia Optimus</a> based laptop.
That was the biggest problem for my custom Fedora install.
It led to many workarounds and dumb hacks.
This sucked, because I wanted to run this install on many laptops.
These workarounds wouldn&rsquo;t work on other devices with different hardware.
This would lead to me constantly maintaining all of the devices using Fedora Everything.
I then stopped using Fedora.</p>
<h2 id="the-switch-to-arch">The Switch to Arch</h2>
<p>Initially I didn&rsquo;t want to use Arch on the laptop.
Mostly because most people on the internet says &ldquo;it&rsquo;s unstable.&rdquo;
If I&rsquo;m doing a laptop install, it needs to &ldquo;just work.&rdquo;
I&rsquo;m not gonna have the time to mess around trying to get things working.</p>
<p>But I thought about it more.
I reconsidered.
I have ran my Arch install for almost a year on my desktop.
Guess what?
No problems!
I probably had one or two things that broke.
But at the end of the day it was my fault that they broke in the first place.</p>
<h2 id="the-archening-begins">The Archening begins</h2>
<p>Installing Arch was very straightforward.
I downloaded the latest <a href="https://archlinux.org/download/">Arch ISO</a>.
And I had it livebooted in no time.
Running the Arch guided installer was very straightforward and I had all the customization I needed.
It allowed you to install most desktop environments and some window managers.
As well as installing your own packages if you so choose.
It even gave me the option to install my Nvidia drivers.</p>
<p>Instead of going my typical window manager route, I went with <a href="https://kde.org/plasma-desktop/">KDE Plasma</a>.
I&rsquo;m so glad I did.
Everything seems to work right out of the box.
Which is exactly what I needed.
When it booted into Plasma there was very few apps installed.
Last time I installed Plasma I had a ton of KDE apps I didn&rsquo;t use.
It bloated up the system, and trying to delete them was a pain in the butt.
I&rsquo;m really glad to see that it&rsquo;s very minimal and I still have a lot of room to customize my install.
It also seems to use up way less resources than Gnome.
Plasma was super snappy and I&rsquo;m really impressed how well it ran.
Can we talk about the number of packages.
I know packages aren&rsquo;t everything, but holy cow!
When I was done with installing all of my apps and Plasma I had 700 packages!
By comparison, my Fedora Everything install had that many before I even started installing stuff.</p>
<p>My fresh Plasma install had almost no problems.
As always you get display issues on Nvidia Optimus laptops.
But it was an extremely simple fix.
<a href="https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/NVIDIA_Optimus#No_screens_found_on_a_laptop/NVIDIA_Optimus">You can fix it</a> with changing your display manager configuration or your xorg conf.
You are also gonna have to switch from Wayland to Xorg in order for this to work.
You gotta love Nvidia, making things harder for everyone.
But after that fix, everything has been great!
I&rsquo;ve been running it for over a week now.
No problems!</p>
<h2 id="arch-is-for-beginners">Arch is for Beginners</h2>
<p>In my opinion I believe Arch is one of the best distros for beginners.
Now let me clear this up.
By beginners I mean anyone with some good computer experience that&rsquo;s new to Linux.
The average Joe is always gonna have a harder time on Linux.
Especially if they are running into problems just using Windows.</p>
<p>You could say the terminal pushes away the beginners, your gonna have to touch the terminal in the installation.
But if you&rsquo;re gonna use Linux you&rsquo;re eventually gonna have to use the terminal.
The guided Arch installer opens the door to more people.
If you haven&rsquo;t used Arch yet, I recommend you try it in a Virtual Machine and see how you like it.
Just go through the guided installer and see what you like.</p>
<p>Fedora could have been just fine.
My main issue came from not using the official workstation release.
Fedora workstation really wasn&rsquo;t my thing.
Finding packages is quite a bit of work with Fedora.
It&rsquo;s a smaller distro so many guides simply wouldn&rsquo;t tell you what the Fedora equivalent packages are.
This leads to it taking more time hunting down packages.</p>
<p>With Arch, even if the application I want isn&rsquo;t in the repo, I can just go to the <a href="https://aur.archlinux.org/">AUR (Arch User Repository)</a>.
Almost any app that runs on linux will probably be in there.
Rarely are you ever gonna have to install dependencies or compile things yourself.
Which is even easier for beginners.</p>

The <a href="https://www.steamdeck.com/en/">Steam Deck</a> is gonna lead to the biggest shift in the pc gaming industry.</p>
<h2 id="a-hitch-hikers-guide-to-the-steam-deck-">A hitch hikers guide to the Steam Deck 🕹️</h2>
<p>The Steam Deck is a handheld x86 based computer. It runs a custom AMD APU running Zen 2 and RDNA 2. The Steam Deck runs <a href="https://archlinux.org/">Arch Linux</a> as it&rsquo;s kernel in it&rsquo;s custom operating system called Steam OS 3.0.</p>
<h3 id="steam-os-beginnings">Steam OS Beginnings</h3>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="/images/posts/steam-deck-is-huge-for-gamedevs/big-picture.webp" alt="Steam OS"  />

<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SteamOS">Steam OS has been around ever since the end of 2013</a>. Gabe Newell had a very clear vision for Steam OS. At LinuxCon he stated <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2013/09/gabe-newell-linux-is-the-future-of-gaming-new-hardware-coming-soon/">&ldquo;Linux and open source are the future of gaming.&rdquo;</a> The idea of running Windows games on Linux is not a new idea to Valve. They have been working on their compatibility layer called <a href="https://github.com/ValveSoftware/Proton">Proton</a> for a long time. Proton is a fork of <a href="https://www.winehq.org/">Wine</a>, which is a tool to run Windows executables on Linux. Valve first used Steam OS on their <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steam_Machine_(computer)">Steam Machines</a> in 2015. Basically Steam Machines were just to bring a console like experience to a personal computer. This led to the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/353370/Steam_Controller/">Steam Controllers</a> and <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/bigpicture">Steam Big Picture</a>.</p>
<h3 id="steam-machines-failed">Steam Machines Failed</h3>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="/images/posts/steam-deck-is-huge-for-gamedevs/steam-machine.webp" alt="Steam Machine"  />

At the time, Steam OS was a very cool concept, but lacked in terms of hardware and game support. Which led to the <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/app/221410/discussions/0/1696043806550421224/">Steam Machines being discontinued in 2018</a>. Valve stated that they still have a vision for Steam OS and will continue to improve it, even after discontinuing the Steam Machines.</p>
<h3 id="steam-deck-announcement">Steam Deck Announcement</h3>
<p>Towards the end of 2021 the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AlWgZhMtlWo">Steam Deck was announced</a>. The Steam Deck was made possible by the software that Valve has continued to improve over the course of about 9 years. It was also only possible by the contributions and the dedication of the free and open source community. The Steam Deck introduced a new way to play PC games. Often it&rsquo;s compared to the Nintendo Switch in terms of form factor, but the two systems are dramatically different and created for very different audiences.</p>
<h2 id="other-handheld-pcs">Other handheld PCs</h2>
<p>The idea of a handheld computer has been around for a very long time. But the hardware never caught up to the current generation. Until now. If you have been paying any attention to the handheld computer space in the past 2 years, you would know that the market is beginning to become mainstream.</p>
<p>I owned a <a href="https://www.gpd.hk/gdpwin2">GPD Win 2</a> before my Steam Deck. It doesn&rsquo;t really have a lot of processing power, but basically every 2D indie game would run perfectly on it. It was interesting to tinker with it, often you could boost performance and battery life by playing with the TDP and under volting the machine. This opens up the possibilities of playing a few AAA pc games.</p>
<p>This year alone, two handhelds are gonna be competing with the Steam Deck at it&rsquo;s price point.</p>

</tbody>
</table>
<p>There&rsquo;s definitely an expanding market here. One that I believe game developers should design games with this usecase in mind.</p>
<h2 id="indie-games-benefit-most-from-handheld-systems">Indie games benefit most from handheld systems</h2>
<p>Whenever you have portable hardware, the games that are played the most are usually casual. I mean some people play Call of Duty Mobile on their phones, but most people play simple and addictive time killer games.</p>
<p>Take the Nintendo Switch as an example. Basically all of the Nintendo Switch library is backed by indie games. Aside from the Nintendo AAA games, people mostly play indie games on the system. Nintendo knows this, they have been promoting indies for a while now using <a href="https://twitter.com/indieworldna">indie world</a>.</p>
<p>In my experience playing on the Steam Deck, I would often lean towards the more casual indie games.</p>
<ul>
<li>They are much easier to jump straight into, especially if I just have a few minutes to spare.</li>
<li>They use up very little battery. Some games can go up to 7 hours before the unit dies.</li>
</ul>
<p>Most of the time, I just found them more enjoyable. Now that&rsquo;s obviously just my opinion. Plenty of people are enjoying modern AAA games on their Steam Decks right now. But by the stats of the previous systems in a similar form factor, I can confidently say that the Steam Deck is gonna sell more indie game developers games that support the platform.</p>
<h2 id="great-on-deck">Great on Deck</h2>
<p>Since the Steam Deck is running Steam OS and is Linux based. Not all games work flawlessly on it. Proton does an amazing job getting most games running on the system. But there are a few that will continue to have issues until devs support it.</p>
<p><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/greatondeck">Great on Deck</a> was created to help customers make sure they are buying games that run well on the system. As an indie game dev, the goal should be to get your game supported. Games that are supported overall get a lot more game sales compared to games that aren&rsquo;t supported on Steam Deck. I would start by integrating the <a href="https://partner.steamgames.com/doc/sdk/api">SteamWorks api</a> into your game. Adding achievements, cloud saves, and steam input can go a long way for your game.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>Just some of my quick thoughts on the current handheld gaming market and how indie game developers can benefit from it. I would totally recommend if you are a current game developer to look into the Steam Deck and other gaming handhelds. It&rsquo;s an interesting market right now, and it&rsquo;s just starting to become more mainstream.</p>

<h2 id="apps">Apps</h2>
<h3 id="docker">Docker</h3>
<p>After using docker for a while I quickly realized the limitations of the tool. Every time you want to make a change or update the container you have to recreate the application from the ground up. All of the configuration you do inside the application all gets removed and you start fresh every time. Oh, and if you want to actually update it, you have to manually remove the container and rerun your docker command.</p>
<p>The solution to all of these is quite simple. <strong>Don&rsquo;t use DOCKER.</strong> <em>Instead use docker-compose.</em></p>
<p><a href="https://docs.docker.com/compose/">Docker compose</a> essentially automates the whole process for the user. All you have to do is save a docker-compose.yml file which configures the application. At any time you can pull the latest updates and have your docker back up and running. <em>But wait, what about the application&rsquo;s config?</em> Yeah, by default it will be wiped every time. The solution is to mount the configuration of the file in a <strong>volume</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>Volumes</strong> <em>are way of passing files from your local file system back into your application</em>. The app has no access to any files outside the container by default. The solution is to now mount the configuration of the application back into your file system outside your container. Then the application will write to that mounted directory it&rsquo;s configuration files and the files will no longer be dependent on the application. You can modify them outside of the application, you can remove the application and recreate it and if you still have the config files mounted then the application will continue to maintain persistence when you make changes to it.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.linuxserver.io/">Linux Server</a> <strong>I can&rsquo;t recommend using their dockers enough</strong>. They essentially take a lot of self hosted applications that people use and make them easier. Configuration is often done with one config folder, just mount it once and boom you are done. Using and configuring their apps are a lot more intuitive than others. <em>But what about the updates?</em> Yeah I mean you can only assume if you use someone else&rsquo;s packages you are at the mercy of them maintaining it. But you don&rsquo;t have to worry about it with <strong>Linux Server</strong>. They have some sort of bot/script that seems to generate these packages whenever updates go through on the apps. Which means you get the latest applications, and don&rsquo;t have to worry about missing features or vulnerabilities.</p>

It also containers certbot which essentially is able to give your website HTTPS encryption all you have to do is configure your domain, add your email to the environment variable, and boom you got an HTTPS website. It comes with other stuff to like cloudflare integration, and many other useful things that just save you so much time.</p>
<p>In order to enable reverse proxy on your apps, locate your swag config folder then go to nginx/proxy-confs. You will see a huge list of all the apps, locate the app you want to reverse proxy.</p>
<p>When you reverse proxy, you will usually have two options&hellip;</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>subfolder</strong>
<ul>
<li>example.com/myapp</li>
<li>requires no extra ssl certificates to sign</li>
<li>no dns configuration required</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>subdomain</strong>
<ul>
<li>myapp.example.com</li>
<li>every subdomain needs a signed ssl certificate</li>
<li>requires subdomain to be added to the &ldquo;SUBDOMAINS&rdquo; environment variable in docker compose</li>
<li>requires cname record to to be added to dns</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>I perfer to reverse proxy subfolders, they are a lot less work than subdomains, <em>but certain apps will require a subdomain reverse proxy.</em></p>
<p>To enable the reverse proxy for your app, just copy the myapp.subdomain/subfolder.conf.sample to myapp.subdomain/subfolder.conf. Essentially just remove the .sample portion of the file name, that will activate it to be used by the reverse proxy. <strong>Please note that if you don&rsquo;t rename your containers correctly this will not work.</strong> In the proxy configs it uses the container name to get the ip address of the container through the docker network. If you use the ip address of the container in the reverse proxy instead of the name you will have problems because the ip addresses get changed everytime you initialize your containers. So it&rsquo;s best to use the name in the reverse proxy.</p>
<p>After configuring the reverse proxy you need to restart the swag service using&hellip;</p>

      <description>The Plexining 🎬 Ever since we got our NAS we had Plex on it. But we didn&amp;rsquo;t have much on it. Plex is just a media server that hosts all your files and media in one easy to access streamable way. Anyways, I figured it&amp;rsquo;s about time to start utilizing this NAS a lot more. I needed to migrate our entire library of movies from Vudu, Amazon, and Google Play Movies to the NAS.</description>

<p>Ever since we got our NAS we had Plex on it. But we didn&rsquo;t have much on it. <a href="https://www.plex.tv/">Plex</a> is just a media server that hosts all your files and media in one easy to access streamable way. Anyways, I figured it&rsquo;s about time to start utilizing this NAS a lot more. I needed to migrate our entire library of movies from Vudu, Amazon, and Google Play Movies to the NAS. Since I don&rsquo;t wanna be a pirate I&rsquo;m gonna do things the hard way.</p>
<p>I also use Jellyfin on my media server as a backup if my NAS can&rsquo;t reach Plex&rsquo;s servers. Which is kinda dumb to selfhost Plex and than still be dependent on their own servers to be online. But whatever, still own my own media so if Plex doesn&rsquo;t work I can easily move to the next platform.</p>
<p>I decided to mainly use Plex because&hellip;</p>
<ul>
<li>My dad already owned Plex Pass. (Basically allows for transcoding and DVR functionality)</li>
<li>The app works natively on our smart tv. But it&rsquo;s extremely slow and terrible, but better than nothing.</li>
<li>It supports automatically deleting commericials on live tv.</li>
<li>HDR to SDR tonemapping support actually works. (Jellyfin doesn&rsquo;t natively support it but you can use an external media player that does)</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="the-rippining-">The Rippining 📀</h2>
<p>We owned like 3 movies on BluRay, and already had a drive that I can rip from. So it was time to get to work. The process suprisingly wasn&rsquo;t too difficult. MakeMKV does most of the heavylifting for you. All MakeMKV does is bypass the DRM on the disc and decrypt it leading you with an h.264 video that gets containerized into a mkv file. Most of the movies on BluRays range from 20gb to 100gb. If that&rsquo;s too much for you, you can always compress them down in smaller sizes using handbrake.</p>
<p>My recommended <a href="https://handbrake.fr/">HandBrake</a> settings for compressing BluRays&hellip;</p>
<ul>
<li>Format: Matroska</li>
<li>Encoder: H.265 10 bit</li>
<li>FrameRate: Same as Video</li>
<li>FrameRate: Constant</li>
<li>Quality: 20</li>
<li>Audio make sure to include 5.7 surround sound or 7.1 based on your setup.</li>
<li>You can also compress the audio down to 640kbps if you so choose.</li>
</ul>
<p>The reason I use h265 is for the high amount of detail that remains once you compress. But it has a few major drawbacks.</p>
<p>These drawbacks include&hellip;</p>
<ul>
<li>A lot of resources to compress video footage.</li>
<li>The codec has tons of licensing issues, so playback may not be native on your device.</li>
<li>Due to the licensing issues not all devices support h265</li>
</ul>
<p>If you are reading this article in the future, you may want to consider compressing videos in AV1. I hear that&rsquo;s gonna be the next big thing. AV1 at its core is essentially just like h265 whereas it perserves a lot of details at a highly compressed size. But the codec is open source and doesn&rsquo;t have any licensing issues. It&rsquo;s also quite a bit more efficent than h265, so you will be expirencing better quality at the same file size. The only issue is at the time of writing this article, nobody really supports it much. So as that changes it may be a good thing to look into if you are concerned about storage space.</p>
<h2 id="makemkv-on-linux-small-guide">MakeMKV on Linux: Small Guide</h2>
<p>I installed MakeMKV on Arch Linux, so this won&rsquo;t apply to Debian users (sorry).</p>
<p>If you are on debian you can look <a href="https://forum.makemkv.com/forum/viewtopic.php?f=3&amp;t=224">here</a>. I had issues doing the official downloads and compilation on my end. But I&rsquo;m sure that was my fault in the first place.</p>
<p>But I was able to get my own build of MakeMKV on the <a href="https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/makemkv/">AUR (Arch User Repository)</a> and that seemed to be working just fine for me. Also auto updates are way cool. You also want to make sure you get the <a href="https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/makemkv-libaacs/">aacs libraries</a> for Linux.</p>
<p>Optical drives on Arch Linux is kind of a pain to get working. If you get the error that MakeMKV can&rsquo;t find any Optical Drives in Arch Linux, it&rsquo;s not MakeMKV&rsquo;s fault. I found the solution to this problem in this <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/makemkv/comments/r3jijh/arch_linux_this_program_cant_find_any_usable/">Reddit post</a>. According to the post the solution is to: &ldquo;Create a file on /etc/modules-load.d/ with the content sg then reboot. Mine is named sg.conf but the name is totally arbitrary.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And that should be everything, that&rsquo;s everything I needed to do to get this to work.</p>
<h2 id="issues-ripping-new-movies-">Issues Ripping New Movies? ❌</h2>
<p>MakeMKV is able to decrypt movies by using of Volume Unique Keys (VUKS) from a database. If you have a recent movie that won&rsquo;t rip, then on MakeMKV go download the latest keys from <a href="http://fvonline-db.bplaced.net/">FindVUK Online Database.</a> Then place the keydb.cfg file in the folder that MakeMKV is installed in. It should automatically recognize it and use the local database in combination with their own online database. If you are still having issues, there are tools to manually get the VUK key but it will require <a href="https://www.dvdfab.cn/">DVDfab</a> and another tool called <a href="https://forum.doom9.org/showthread.php?t=172472">FindVUK</a> to extract the VUK from memory on DVDfab.</p>
<h2 id="drives-matter">Drives Matter</h2>
<p>The Blu-Ray drive you use for ripping can make all of the difference. When ripping movies you need to get a perfect copy off of the drive, if there&rsquo;s any piece of data or information that can&rsquo;t be read on the drive it will be unable to rip. Certain Blu-Ray drives are much more affective when reading scratched disks. With my old Blu-Ray player I would have what seems to be a perfect copy of the movie, no scratches noticable, and yet it would run into read errors. They can also have faster read speeds which will speed up the process of ripping each disk.</p>
<h2 id="libredrive-">Libredrive 🪛</h2>
<p>Libedrive is very cool because, many blu-ray players &ldquo;don&rsquo;t support 4k (UHD).&rdquo; Yet they are fully capable of playing them back. There&rsquo;s just this little police in the firmware that tells it to not play back the 4k disk. With Libredrive we are effectively overwriting the firmware on the disk to force it to play back any sort of disk in the system.</p>
<p>If you are planning on getting a Blu-Ray player I definitely recommend getting one that Libredrive supports. It only supports very specific drives, but you can find what drive to get on the <a href="https://forum.makemkv.com/forum/viewtopic.php?t=19634">MakeMKV forums</a></p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>Owning my media is important to me. Unfortunately with movies you can&rsquo;t really own your movies &ldquo;legally.&rdquo; The simple act of breaking the encryption on the disk is illegal. Yet creating personal backups of media is totally legal. So kind of in the gray area, but since I am buying copies of physical media from the official retailers I feel like it&rsquo;s ethical to do this. If you typically stream your media and don&rsquo;t watch very many Blu-Rays you are gonna see a huge jump in quality. The bitrate makes all of the difference, resolutions are overrated, you can be watching a highly compressed 4k stream on Netflix and a 1080p Blu-Ray will almost always look better than that compressed stream. To a typical person this isn&rsquo;t easy and they would opt for just watching all their movies on streaming services. And I can agree, it&rsquo;s not user friendly and your going to have to maintain your own server. But I enjoy it, so that&rsquo;s how I&rsquo;m gonna watch my media.</p>
