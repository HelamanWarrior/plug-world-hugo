  "articleBody": "Crazy right!?\nWhy do this? Here‚Äôs why‚Ä¶ Addiction Social media is naturally made to be addictive. Over the past 10 years, social media has been finetuned to work against you and to push for your attention. Social Media Impacts the Whole World Maybe a sound like a conspiracy theorist when I say this, but unlike them there‚Äôs actually evidence. Most people use social media, it impacts a very large aspect of the world. Most social media generally has an ‚Äúalgorithm‚Äù to promote content. This algorithm is always being balanced and modified ever so slightly. They modify it to make people think certain ways, or to promote certain types of content over others. Effectively giving them the ability to brainwash the world. Don‚Äôt believe me? Look at those Tiktok challenges. No other platform promoted these challenges as much as Tiktok. It convinced people to do stupid things that they wouldn‚Äôt have done otherwise. It even got to the point that schools had to shutdown. So believe what you want, but you can‚Äôt deny social media has the biggest impact, bigger than the greatest kings and queens of the world. Not Being in Control Over Content How are you not in control? You get to choose who you follow. Yep you do, but I constantly get crap in my feed that I don‚Äôt want to see. Things that I don‚Äôt follow get forced in my face no matter what. I want to be in control of the things that I get to see on social media. In my opinion it would be best just to be connected with your friends and family. I don‚Äôt care about the celebrities and all the other junk that gets thrown in my face. Being a Hypocrite I don‚Äôt support where social media is headed, and how manipulative it‚Äôs getting. Therefore, I will not use it. Under normal circumstances Why I Kinda Use Social Media A couple of months ago I deleted my Instagram account. I used it primary with connecting with friends. And since then I have started to regret it.\nHere‚Äôs my philosophy that led to me deleting it.\nIf you don‚Äôt support it, don‚Äôt use it.\nYou know, basically don‚Äôt be a hypocrite.\nSince then, I missed seeing what my friends are up to and connecting to them through that. So it‚Äôs hard to support both, you know? I don‚Äôt want to support Facebook by using Instagram, but I want to support my friends by seeing and messaging with them on the platform.\nSo I decided to get back on the platform. But I have a specific way of going about things that screws over Facebook and Instagram üòÇ\nThe Solution I won‚Äôt post on Instagram. I will instead be using my microblog.\nPosts on my microblog will be similar to how I would post on Instagram. I will keep my blog seperate, because my posts there will be more technical and informational. I stay connected with friends by using Instaloader. Which basically allows me to download the posts and stories from the people I follow and watch that content locally on my computer.\nThis is great because‚Ä¶\nI only see the content from the people I follow. It doesn‚Äôt support Instagram since I‚Äôm not using their official site and viewing ads. There is no addiction. Limited amount of content, not engineered in a way to take as much attention as possible. Anyways, social media is messy and big tech is making it a terrible platform to be on. Social media isn‚Äôt all bad, it has definitely been used for good. People have good intentions but they often get sucked away by this.\nGet a Website If you are reading this and you don‚Äôt have a website, I encourage you get a website!\nEveryone uses the same 5 websites, it‚Äôs important that you own your own land on the internet. Most people can agree owning a house is much better than having to pay rent in an appartment. Do this on the internet! Post what you learn on your website, make posts that you would normally only do on Instagram, and put them on your website.\nThe information you learn is valuable, and your experiences and memories are unreplacable. With a website you have the freedom to display your information however you want and the freedom to own it.\nI have found that this has made me a better writer, and has helped keep my thoughts more clear and organized. It may seem like a lot of work, but you can get a lot out of doing this.\nYou can use Wordpress or Blogger, just start using something.\nI use Hugo which is a bit more advanced for the average user, but still very simple once setup.\nConclusion Social media addiction is really harmful. Please try to find what works best for you. I find with this solution I have been able to improve myself, while also maintaining connection with my friends and family. That‚Äôs what matters most, do your best to be better, little by little everyday. You will find that you can do amazing things.\nDon‚Äôt start tomorrow, start today. Thank you for taking the time to read to read this. Please contact me if you have any questions, or if you just want to talk. Thanks! üòÉ\n",

But I have a specific way of going about things that screws over Facebook and Instagram üòÇ</p>
<h2 id="the-solution">The Solution<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#the-solution">#</a></h2>
<p>I won&rsquo;t post on Instagram.
I will instead be using my <a href="/microblog">microblog</a>.</p>
<ul>
<li>Posts on my microblog will be similar to how I would post on Instagram.</li>
<li>I will keep my <a href="/posts">blog</a> seperate, because my posts there will be more technical and informational.</li>
</ul>
<p>I stay connected with friends by using <a href="https://instaloader.github.io/">Instaloader</a>.
Which basically allows me to download the posts and stories from the people I follow and watch that content locally on my computer.</p>
<p>This is great because&hellip;</p>
<ul>
<li>I only see the content from the people I follow.</li>
<li>It doesn&rsquo;t support Instagram since I&rsquo;m not using their official site and viewing ads.</li>
<li>There is no addiction. Limited amount of content, not engineered in a way to take as much attention as possible.</li>
</ul>
<p>Anyways, social media is messy and big tech is making it a terrible platform to be on.
Social media isn&rsquo;t all bad, it has definitely been used for good.
People have good intentions but they often get sucked away by this.</p>
<h2 id="get-a-website">Get a Website<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#get-a-website">#</a></h2>
<p>If you are reading this and you don&rsquo;t have a website, I encourage you <strong>get a website!</strong></p>
<p>Everyone uses the same 5 websites, it&rsquo;s important that you own your own land on the internet.
Most people can agree owning a house is much better than having to pay rent in an appartment.
<strong>Do this on the internet!</strong>
Post what you learn on your website, make posts that you would normally only do on Instagram, and put them on your website.</p>
<p>The information you learn is valuable, and your experiences and memories are unreplacable.
With a website you have the freedom to display your information however you want and the freedom to own it.</p>
<p>I have found that this has made me a better writer, and has helped keep my thoughts more clear and organized.
It may seem like a lot of work, but you can get a lot out of doing this.</p>
<p>You can use <a href="https://wordpress.org/">Wordpress</a> or <a href="https://blogger.com">Blogger</a>, just start using something.</p>
<p>I use <a href="https://gohugo.io/">Hugo</a> which is a bit more advanced for the average user, but still very simple once setup.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#conclusion">#</a></h2>
<p>Social media addiction is really harmful.
Please try to find what works best for you.
I find with this solution I have been able to improve myself, while also maintaining connection with my friends and family.
That&rsquo;s what matters most, do your best to be better, little by little everyday.
You will find that you can do amazing things.</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t start tomorrow, start today.
Thank you for taking the time to read to read this.

Thanks! üòÉ</p>
